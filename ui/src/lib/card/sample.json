Marie Lambeau has you covered <\/span><\/center>\r\n<br>\r\nTired of watching your Rogue friends take turns that never seem to end?<br>\r\nDo they play half their deck, take six actions, draw three cards, gain four resources\u2026 and still have time to complain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you secretly want those 5-actions turns too\u2026 but without touching a single green card?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2728Marie Lambeau has the solution!\u2728<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to her extra action, a little bit of doom juggling, and some very questionable Mystic life choices, Marie can chain actions, play absurdly long turns, and make the table ask:\r\n\u201cWait\u2026 are you done yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[![dsfsdf.jpg](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/dhkKV5Mq\/dsfsdf.jpg)](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/dhkKV5Mq)\r\nCredit to: Pablofetada\r\n<br><br> \r\n___\r\n\r\n<center><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><\/center>\r\n\r\n**<center><span style=\"font-family:FONT;

color:purple; font-size:x-large;\">Blood of Leo de Luca<\/span><\/center>**\r\n\r\nAt first glance, this might look a bit silly, but Marie Lambeau is basically always going to be played with [Blood Pact](\/card\/02191) and [Sin-Eater](\/card\/09094).<br>\r\nGiven that, using the accessory slot for [Blood of Leo](\/card\/11065) is simply about guaranteeing an extra action every single turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the card does far more than just enable that core combo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny card that places doom will also place an offering on [Blood of Leo](\/card\/11065), which means you can overstock offerings and save them for when you actually need them.<br>\r\n(Yes, you could even throw in something like Spectral Shield if you expect to be swimming in offerings.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that [Blood of Thoth](\/card\/11065) is Leo de Luca on steroids.<br>\r\nNot only does it give an extra action, but that action can be taken by you or by any other investigator at your location, even outside of their own turn.<br>\r\nThis adds an absurd amount of flexibility, you can now nest actions from different investigators within the same turn (take that, Carson!).<br>\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n\r\n<center><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><\/center>\r\n\r\n**<center><span style=\"font-family:FONT; color:purple; font-size:x-large;\">Cat Mask<\/span><\/center>**\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s talk about the [Cat Mask](\/card\/10084).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can spend one offering to gain +2 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"><\/span> on a test.<br>\r\nOn the very next test, you spend the second offering for another +2<span class=\"icon-willpower\"><\/span> , then trigger Blood Pact for an additional +3<span class=\"icon-willpower\"><\/span>  and just like that, both offerings on the Mask are immediately refilled! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn practice, this means you should be sitting at a minimum of 6<span class=\"icon-willpower\"><\/span>  on essentially every  test, with very little effort.<br>\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<center><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><\/center>\r\n\r\n**<center><span style=\"font-family:FONT; color:purple; font-size:x-large;\">Main Strategy<\/span><\/center>**\r\n\r\nThe very first thing you\u2019ll need to do is take a **Parley** action with your friends: doom will appear early, and it will keep appearing. This is not panic-worthy behavior. In this deck, doom isn\u2019t a countdown to disaster; it\u2019s a tool. Everything is intentional, everything is accounted for, and no agendas are being flipped \u201cby accident\u201d. Promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that collective leap of faith is taken, your first real goal is to get [Blood of Thoth](\/card\/1106) into play, along with [Arcane Initiate](\/card\/01563), who will dutifully dig up the spells you actually want to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can mostly treat the card list above as a suggestion, not a rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWant to focus on fighting? Slot in [Shrivelling](\/card\/01560) \/ [Azure Flame](\/card\/60407) (take care with this, [someone](\/card\/05019) might get very angry if you see an ugly symbol).<br>\r\nPrefer clue-gathering? [Clairvoyance](\/card\/60408) has you covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, you can upgrade into [Lost Arcana](\/card\/11078) to dramatically increase your charge economy. And if you somehow still run dry, you can always loop charges back with [Ghastly Possession](\/card\/09090), or just ignore charges entirely and activate spells without spending any, thanks to [Knowledge is Power](\/card\/05231).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this deck balanced?<br>\r\nProbably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill your turns be longer than everyone else\u2019s combined?<br>\r\nAbsolutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust remember: the doom is under control, and if anyone doubts it, you probably still have an action left to [prove them wrong](\/card\/02267).<br>\r\n___\r\n\r\n<center><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><\/center>\r\n\r\n**<center><span style=\"font-family:FONT; color:purple; font-size:x-large;\">Good luck & have fun!<\/span><\/center>**\r\n\r\nAs always, if you have any doubt or recommendation, tell me!  <br>\r\nLikes are appreciated :)",
