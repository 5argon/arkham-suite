	"description_md": "\"Mahou Shoujo\" means \"magical girl\", a Japanese story genre where a girl with seemingly normal life can transform to another self, often with changed appearance and a signature weapon. This deck is named so because there is a certain pink-haired magical girl that uses a [bow](\/card\/08118) as her signature weapon. Now you can make a contract (pay health) and pretend to be one with just an EotE expansion! (And print her [parallel front](https:\/\/www.fantasyflightgames.com\/en\/news\/2020\/12\/3\/bad-blood\/).)\r\n\r\nThe highlight of this deck is spamming [Blinding Light](\/card\/01066) and while you are disengaged, reposition yourself to shoot the [Enchanted Bow](\/card\/08118) at range. [Blinding Light](\/card\/01066) should be recycled with her \"blood magic\" ability so it starts coming again more and more often as your deck thins out.\r\n\r\nThis deck uses **only the front side** of Parallel Agnes, therefore retaining her <span class=\"icon-survivor\"><\/span> access to various health sponges. Side quest includes using [Divination](\/card\/08101) to trigger [Scavenging](\/card\/01073) while the enemy is blinded to recover [Advanced Heirloom of Hyperborea](\/card\/90018), which is now a soak asset for use with \"blood magic\", among other tanking stuff such as [Leather Coat](\/card\/01072) and [Holy Rosary](\/card\/01059).\r\n\r\n<span class=\"thumbnail small\">\r\n**\u25ba About \"2 Packs Deck Guide\"**<br>\u3000A series of decks made with the new distribution model in mind, requiring a Revised Core Set box + **just 1 more** Investigator Expansion box. \u2744 character on the deck's name means the additional box it uses is [**Edge of the Earth Investigator Expansion**](https:\/\/www.fantasyflightgames.com\/en\/products\/arkham-horror-the-card-game\/products\/arkham-horror-card-game-edge-earth-investigator-expansion\/).<br>\u3000It maximizes the chance of newcomers being able to build and learn to play the game, enjoying the story on Standard difficulty ASAP.

(A magical arrow comes back on the next turn, it does not come with an arrow quiver...)\r\n- Close range fighting is unlimited, the bow's charge is only required for ranged attacks.\r\n- Always 2 damages, and starts at absurd accuracy of 6 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"><\/span> for Agnes.\r\n- Refill the ranged charges with [Winds of Power](\/card\/08063), which is possible to get via [Parallel Fates](\/card\/08066).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Blinding Light**<\/span>](\/card\/01569) <span class=\"small\"><span class=\"card-xp\">\u2022\u2022<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n- The filler when you need to repeatedly attack an enemy. If succeed, grants you an another turn that the bow is ready once again. You may or may not walk away after doing this. \r\n- Dealing damage as the same time as evading is very powerful. It ensures you can drag out the fight without damage and make progress to end the fight in the same test, where regular evasion you would also need to attack it somehow.\r\n- Evade also grants AoO free moment, which you may use to investigate with [Divination](\/card\/08101) while waiting for the next turn or just move away, or use [Ethereal Slip](\/card\/08108) for an extra cool impression that you disappeared after the light faded out.\r\n- Keep using \"blood magic\" if possible, until your deck really thins down, which at that moment you are likely fighting the big guy with annoying minions you really want to blind them.\r\n- Even the upgraded version is stinky and not giving you any <span class=\"icon-willpower\"><\/span> bonus. In mid-campaign, we will get [Prophetic](\/card\/08120) to improve the chance.\r\n\r\n# In the Thick of It XP\r\n\r\nChoose to take 2 physical trauma (makes it riskier to use blood magic often) to get these nice cards right from the start with your 3 XP from [In the Thick of It](\/card\/08125) : \r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**2x Divination**<\/span>](\/card\/08101) <span class=\"card-xp\">\u2022<\/span>\r\n\r\nWaiting to receive [Down the Rabbit Hole](\/card\/08059) discount without taking purchase penalty. Also make you more functional from scenario 1, as you can trigger [Scavenging](\/card\/01073) with it.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Mind Wipe**<\/span>](\/card\/01568) <span class=\"card-xp\">\u2022<\/span>\r\n\r\nThis is a card you sometimes glad you have it at a certain \"moment\". By keep using \"blood magic\", you have more chance of having it on that \"moment\" rather than having to hog it on hand.\r\n\r\n# Blood magic\r\n\r\nAgnes's parallel front ability is to play **Spell Event** (Does not work on Spell Asset like [Divination](\/card\/08101)) at -2 cost and taking it back to deck, at the cost of 1 damage. Here are all the options : \r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Blinding Light**<\/span>](\/card\/01569) <span class=\"card-xp\">\u2022\u2022<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe \"flash bang\", your never ending offensive + defensive tool. Highly recommended to recurse, it usually translates to surviving longer when the deck really thins down.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Ethereal Slip**<\/span>](\/card\/08110) <span class=\"card-xp\">\u2022\u2022<\/span>\r\n\r\nPosition yourself for shooting the bow, save your team by breaking engagement from far away. Upgraded version is also good as <span class=\"icon-agility\"><\/span> commit, which when you do so, you cannot recycle.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Ward of Protection**<\/span>](\/card\/01565) \r\n\r\nThis card is already very valuable, and now you have an unlimited amount of it! However, it costs 1 horror which parallel front Agnes not having much of. (Try using the matching 2x [Fearless](\/card\/01067) to heal out the cost.) If you get one again while having no spare sanity, <span class=\"icon-wild\"><\/span> icon can still be useful.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Mind Wipe**<\/span>](\/card\/01568) <span class=\"card-xp\">\u2022<\/span>\r\n\r\nUtility card that feels just right having it at 1 copy.  Normally you may think whether to use it or wait for more dangerous non-Elite enemy to show up. Now you can just use it with \"blood magic\" then expect it to come back again later.\r\n\r\n## Blood magic techs\r\n\r\n- 0 XP [Blinding Light](\/card\/01066) and 0 XP [Ethereal Slip](\/card\/08108) are at 2-cost, (discounted to 1 on their upgrades). The ability can help playing them at 0 cost.\r\n- When your deck is low, the \"concentration\" of cards gets higher and it is more likely that you will see the Spell you just recycled. This can feel like you can control the fate somewhat with cards like [Blinding Light](\/card\/01066) (avoid taking hits turns after turns until you win that big final fight) or [Ward of Protection](\/card\/01065) (avoid unexpected mess while fighting the big guy).\r\n  - Therefore, the value of Spell recursion gradually increases if you managed to recur it from when your deck is fuller, until the deck gets very thin, which may cost you multiple health. Choose wisely which one you want to see at later moment.\r\n- In a REAL pinch when you get [Advanced Dark Memory](\/card\/90019) with not enough resources (4) to play and you cannot also take any more horror, you play with recursion (it is a Spell Event) to discount it to 2, add doom, take 1 damage, and shuffle it back to the deck having to see it again. Does not sounds great, but can be better than helplessly defeated.\r\n- You will love having [Arcane Initiate](\/card\/01063) around when recycling spells so you can fetch that spell back on hand fast especially when the deck is thin. But be careful of getting only [Dark Memory](\/card\/90019) as a valid target among 3 cards, which you must draw it.\r\n\r\n# Upgrade guide\r\n\r\nHere are the [Down the Rabbit Hole](\/card\/08059) compatible upgrades in recommended order, max 2 discounted upgrades per scenario. In actual play you would have to decide these based on XP you got each scenario. \r\n\r\n**Remember that** you have to slot in [Enchanted Bow](\/card\/08118) **purchase** (as opposed to upgrade) among these ASAP so you have something better than [Shrivelling](\/card\/01060) to fight with, and that costs 3 XP each. (2 + 1)\r\n\r\nDon't feel bad if after paying for the bow you cannot get to 2 upgrades quota, the bow is more important.\r\n\r\n[\/\/]: # (==================== TABLE START ====================)\r\n|  |  |  |  | \u3000Cost | \u3000Total |\r\n|:-:|:--|:-:|:--|--:|--:|\r\n|\u3000\u3000|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Blinding Light<\/span>](\/card\/01566) |\u3000<span class=\"fg-survivor\">\u2192<\/span>\u3000|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Blinding Light<\/span>](\/card\/01569) <span class=\"small\">\u2022\u2022<\/span>|<span class=\"small\">1 XP<\/span>|<span class=\"small\">1 XP<\/span>|\r\n|\u3000\u3000|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Blinding Light<\/span>](\/card\/01566) |\u3000<span class=\"fg-survivor\">\u2192<\/span>\u3000|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Blinding Light<\/span>](\/card\/01569) <span class=\"small\">\u2022\u2022<\/span>|<span class=\"small\">1 XP<\/span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP<\/span>|\r\n|\u3000\u3000|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-dual small\">Divination<\/span>](\/card\/08101) <span class=\"small\">\u2022<\/span>|\u3000<span class=\"fg-survivor\">\u2192<\/span>\u3000|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-dual small\">Divination<\/span>](\/card\/08103) <span class=\"small\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<\/span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP<\/span>|<span class=\"small\">4 XP<\/span>|\r\n|\u3000\u3000|<span class=\"icon-rogue\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-dual small\">Ethereal Slip<\/span>](\/card\/08108) |\u3000<span class=\"fg-survivor\">\u2192<\/span>\u3000|<span class=\"icon-rogue\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-dual small\">Ethereal Slip<\/span>](\/card\/08110) <span class=\"small\">\u2022\u2022<\/span>|<span class=\"small\">1 XP<\/span>|<span class=\"small\">5 XP<\/span>|\r\n|\u3000\u3000|<span class=\"icon-survivor\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor small\">Lucky!<\/span>](\/card\/01580) |\u3000<span class=\"fg-survivor\">\u2192<\/span>\u3000|<span class=\"icon-survivor\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor small\">Lucky!<\/span>](\/card\/01584) <span class=\"small\">\u2022\u2022<\/span>|<span class=\"small\">1 XP<\/span>|<span class=\"small\">6 XP<\/span>|\r\n|\u3000\u3000|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-dual small\">Divination<\/span>](\/card\/08101) <span class=\"small\">\u2022<\/span>|\u3000<span class=\"fg-survivor\">\u2192<\/span>\u3000|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-dual small\">Divination<\/span>](\/card\/08103) <span class=\"small\">\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<\/span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP<\/span>|<span class=\"small\">8 XP<\/span>|\r\n|\u3000\u3000|<span class=\"icon-survivor\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor small\">Lucky!<\/span>](\/card\/01580) |\u3000<span class=\"fg-survivor\">\u2192<\/span>\u3000|<span class=\"icon-survivor\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor small\">Lucky!<\/span>](\/card\/01584) <span class=\"small\">\u2022\u2022<\/span>|<span class=\"small\">1 XP<\/span>|<span class=\"small\">9 XP<\/span>|\r\n|\u3000\u3000|[<span class=\"fg-neutral small\">Emergency Cache<\/span>](\/card\/01588) |\u3000<span class=\"fg-survivor\">\u2192<\/span>\u3000|[<span class=\"fg-neutral small\">Emergency Cache<\/span>](\/card\/01693) <span class=\"small\">\u2022\u2022<\/span>|<span class=\"small\">1 XP<\/span>|<span class=\"small\">10 XP<\/span>|\r\n<span class=\"small\">[(View at arkham-starter.com)](https:\/\/arkham-starter.com\/tool\/upgrade?i=ChQSBTAxNTY2GgUwMTU2OSABMAE4AQoUEgUwMTU2NhoFMDE1NjkgATABOAIKFBIFMDgxMDEaBTA4MTAzIAEwAjgEChQSBTA4MTA4GgUwODExMCABMAE4BQoUEgUwMTU4MBoFMDE1ODQgATABOAYKFBIFMDgxMDEaBTA4MTAzIAEwAjgIChQSBTAxNTgwGgUwMTU4NCABMAE4CQoUEgUwMTU4OBoFMDE2OTMgATABOAoSRBoCWFAqBwoD4oaSEAEyDQoEQ29zdBIFVG90YWw6BggBEAEYAVABWhwoVmlldyBhdCBhcmtoYW0tc3RhcnRlci5jb20pGhgKBAgBEAMSBBIAGgAaCggBEAEgASgBMAEiB3A6MzcxMzE%3D)<\/span>\r\n[\/\/]: # (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\nAnd here's the purchases which you must pay 1 more for each.

# (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\n# Some tactical tips\r\n\r\nDelay getting hit by a Hunter enemy by using [Enchanted Bow](\/card\/08118) on nearby location, then move once away. The next turn when it closes in, you can do this again as long as you still have charges left on your bow. While doing this, perhaps investigate because you are not engaged yet.\r\n\r\nUpgraded [Ethereal Slip (2)](\/card\/08110) is flexible on a map with enemy scattered. Possibly some of them are Hunter, some of them are not, that cause this situation. You can now \"juke\" the Hunter monster by targeting this spell on a non-Hunter enemy repeatedly to get the required breather room to gear up or perform ranged attack using [Enchanted Bow](\/card\/08118).\r\n\r\nIntentionally stay further from helpless investigator such as a Seeker. When the Seeker draws an enemy, use [Ethereal Slip](\/card\/08108) to swap with an enemy currently engaged with the Seeker to both let the Seeker continue doing the job, and also teleports you to the same location, getting ready to engage and fight when it walks back. Use ranged attack when it is one location away as it walks back, and tell your Guardian to close into it is also a pretty cool combo.\r\n\r\n# Advanced signature yes or no? (yes)\r\n\r\nUsing [Advanced Heirloom of Hyperborea](\/card\/90018) will add soaks, which the 3 sanity is especially reassuring for her parallel front's low sanity. Limitation is that damages and horrors must come from player card. \r\n\r\nThe downside is you have to use [Advanced Dark Memory](\/card\/90019), which is worse than regular one because the cost is increased from 2 to 4, and also you still take 2 horrors if you cannot play it. Remember that she has 6 sanity on her parallel front, this could be critical!\r\n\r\nA silver lining is that [Prophetic](\/card\/08120)'s resources can be used to discount playing [Advanced Dark Memory](\/card\/90019).\r\n\r\nI highly recommended using the Advanced version. Because [Heirloom of Hyperborea](\/card\/90018) being soak asset rather than pure utility asset naturally set it up with [Scavenging](\/card\/01073) triggered with [Divination](\/card\/08101) to revive it and continue soaking \/ using spell recycling ability.\r\n\r\nThe key to remember is that it cannot just tank everything like normal asset, but only from **player cards**. But not to worry, we have quite plenty of these : \r\n\r\n## Player card damages\r\n\r\n- Agnes's [\"blood magic\" ability](\/card\/90017).\r\n\r\n## Player card horrors\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Shrivelling<\/span>](\/card\/01560)  : Replaced with 2x [Enchanted Bow](\/card\/08118)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Ward of Protection<\/span>](\/card\/01565) \r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Blinding Light<\/span>](\/card\/01569) \u2022\u2022 : The 0 XP version does not have horror taking.\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">Dark Memory<\/span>](\/card\/01013)\r\n\r\n# Taking damages\r\n\r\nThe cost to recycle [Blinding Light](\/card\/01066) and [Ethereal Slip](\/card\/08108) is taking damage, along with regular damage you take from enemies and treacheries.\r\n\r\nThese are cards that helps you use this ability as often as possible :\r\n\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">Heirloom of Hyperborea<\/span>](\/card\/90018) \r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">Leather Coat<\/span>](\/card\/01572) \r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">Scavenging<\/span>](\/card\/01573)  : Get back everything above.\r\n\r\nNone of these helps with horror. \r\n\r\n# Taking horror\r\n\r\nThis parallel front Agnes has only 6 sanity. And Survivor does not have many horror soaks in our card pool.\r\n\r\nHorror from your cards can be assigned to [Advanced Heirloom of Hyperborea](\/card\/90018) and recur using [Scavenging](\/card\/01073).\r\n\r\nWe won't get [Relic Hunter](\/card\/01695), therefore [Holy Rosary](\/card\/01059) is in slot contest with [Heirloom of Hyperborea](\/card\/90018). You should use use the sanity on [Holy Rosary](\/card\/01059) liberally as well if you know [Heirloom of Hyperborea](\/card\/90018) is coming soon. Or inversely, the draw effect from [Heirloom of Hyperborea](\/card\/90018) would help you get [Holy Rosary](\/card\/01059).\r\n\r\n[Arcane Initiate](\/card\/01063) has a very good 2 sanity at play cost of only 1. Use these sanity liberally to both kill her quick enough before doom is used to advance the agenda. Remember that [Ward of Protection](\/card\/01065)'s horror cost can also be assigned to [Arcane Initiate](\/card\/01063).\r\n\r\nLastly, trusty 2x [Fearless](\/card\/01067) gives you virtually +2 sanity most of the time.\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Parallel Fates**<\/span>](\/card\/08066) <span class=\"card-xp\">\u2022\u2022<\/span>\r\n\r\n- An obvious combo is to find [Winds of Power](\/card\/08063) among your 6 cards and put it on top, then you draw it, and use <span class=\"icon-reaction\"><\/span> to play it, and possibly discount playing with [Prophetic](\/card\/08120) (because of Spirit trait).\r\n- If you have [Arcane Initiate](\/card\/01063), you can arrange Spell to be at 2nd, 3rd, and 4th card (the 1st card you will draw immediately after), then use <span class=\"icon-fast\"><\/span> to grab it. Maybe critical to get [Enchanted Bow](\/card\/08118) down fast before the bad guys came. (Downside is that the remaining cards will be shuffled away after, making you unsure about the future again.)\r\n- After you have just recycled some spells, especially when the deck is getting thinner, playing [Parallel Fates](\/card\/08066) afterwards may immediately see that spell and allow you to arrange it if you need it back quick. (e.g. [Ward of Protection](\/card\/01065) over and over.)\r\n- It can be used as a search card for your teammates looking for game-changing signature card with not many search tools because it says \"an investigator's deck\". You don't have to be at the same location with that investigator.\r\n- By looking at encounter deck playing 2 players, 6 cards means you can arrange your fate for as far as 3 turns. That is a lot, and can save your teammates (especially <span class=\"icon-rogue\"><\/span>) from <span class=\"icon-willpower\"><\/span> tests.\r\n- Commit icons are similar to [Guts](\/card\/01089).\r\n- In EotE campaign, without spoiling anything, you may came across **many** useful stuff that you can make use of knowing what is on the top, or several top cards of your deck.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Winds of Power**<\/span>](\/card\/08063) <span class=\"card-xp\">\u2022<\/span>\r\n\r\n- The <span class=\"icon-reaction\"><\/span> draw \"during your turn\" occurs due to the following :\r\n  - <span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Parallel Fates<\/span>](\/card\/08066) \u2022\u2022\r\n  - [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">Heirloom of Hyperborea<\/span>](\/card\/90018) \r\n  - [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">Guts<\/span>](\/card\/01589) \r\n  - [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">Manual Dexterity<\/span>](\/card\/01592)\r\n  - You use Draw action.\r\n- [Arcane Initiate](\/card\/01063) **cannot** get this card since it is a Spirit, not a Spell.\r\n- Commit icons are similar to [Guts](\/card\/01089).\r\n- Can be discounted by [Prophetic](\/card\/08120) due to Spirit trait.\r\n- Can refill [Enchanted Bow](\/card\/08118) and [Divination](\/card\/08101).\r\n- Also look for your campaign story assets with \"charges\". Usually these are powerful.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Prophetic**<\/span>](\/card\/08120) <span class=\"card-xp\">\u2022\u2022\u2022<\/span>\r\n\r\n**Discount playing**\r\n\r\n| \u3000 |  | | \u3000Cost\u3000|  |\r\n|:-:|:--|:--|:-:|:-:|\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Blinding Light<\/span>](\/card\/01566)\u3000| Spell Event | 2 |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Blinding Light<\/span>](\/card\/01569) \u2022\u2022\u3000| Spell Event | 1 |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-rogue\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Ethereal Slip<\/span>](\/card\/08108) \u3000| Spell Event |  2 |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-rogue\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Ethereal Slip<\/span>](\/card\/08110) \u2022\u2022\u3000| Spell Event |  1 |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Mind Wipe<\/span>](\/card\/01568) \u2022\u3000| Spell Event | 1 |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Ward of Protection<\/span>](\/card\/01565) \u3000| Spell Event | 1 |\r\n|  | [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">Dark Memory<\/span>](\/card\/90019) \u3000| Spell Event | 4 |\r\n| \u3000 |  |  |  |  |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Shrivelling<\/span>](\/card\/01560) \u3000| Spell Asset | 3 |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-seeker\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Divination<\/span>](\/card\/08103) \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u3000| Spell Asset | 3 |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Enchanted Bow<\/span>](\/card\/08118) \u2022\u2022\u3000| Spell Asset | 3 |\r\n| \u3000 |  |  |  |  |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Winds of Power<\/span>](\/card\/08063) \u2022\u3000| Spirit | 2 |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-survivor\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">\"Look what I found!\"<\/span>](\/card\/01579) \u3000| Fortune | 2 |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-survivor\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">Lucky!<\/span>](\/card\/01580) \u3000| Fortune | 2 |\r\n| \u3000 |  |  |  |  |\r\n\r\nDiscount Spell Event when **not** using \"blood magic\", since that also gives -2 discount.\r\n\r\n**Helps boosting tests**\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Enchanted Bow<\/span>](\/card\/08118) \u2022\u2022\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Divination<\/span>](\/card\/08101) \u2022\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"><\/span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Divination<\/span>](\/card\/08103) \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Blinding Light<\/span>](\/card\/01566)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"><\/span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Blinding Light<\/span>](\/card\/01569) \u2022\u2022\r\n\r\nYou can both discount and boost accuracy of [Blinding Light](\/card\/01066), but generally you want +2 accuracy since even the 2 XP version is stinky and not giving you any bonus.
